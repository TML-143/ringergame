# Ringer Game (v8b)

This build **restores the prior UI layout/look** by making the app **single-file** (inline CSS + JS),
so it renders correctly even if you open `index.html` from a zipped/temporary path.

Includes the v8 upgrades:
- Stats consistency: Targets = Hits + Misses
- Notation readability improvements
- Touch: tap highlighted Spotlight bell during play; bell pads always work (even when stopped)
